One of the fundamental principles that we have at Carbotneq is to deliver our client a consistent, reliable and simply beautiful User Interface (UI). But how do we do that, whilst also trying to minimize our developer cost? The answer to our problem is to buiild a Design System! A design system is a collection of visual and interaction elements, guidelines, and templates that define the look and feel of a product or brand. It acts as a blueprint for designing, building, and maintaining digital products and services. A design system can also improve the user experience by providing clear and predictable visual cues, making it easier for users to navigate and understand a product. A well-designed and well-implemented design system can also speed up the design and development process, freeing up time and resources for more complex design challenges. With all of the benefints mentioned above! How do we go about building an automated design system?

Firstly, let us list all of the potential technologies any team would need in order to build a design system. These would include:

1. Design software: Design software such as Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma, and InVision can be used to create the visual elements of a design system, such as icons, typography, and color palettes. These tools also allow for collaboration among designers and provide a way to store and manage design assets.

2. Style guides and pattern libraries: Style guides and pattern libraries, such as KSS, Fractal, Living Styleguides, and Ant Design  provide a way to document and organize the components of a design system. They serve as a reference for designers and developers, making it easier to apply the design system consistently across different products and services.

3. Front-end development frameworks: Front-end development frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Foundation, and Material Design, can be used to build the components of a design system. These frameworks provide a set of reusable components and styles, making it easier to create and maintain consistent designs across different products and services.

4. Version control systems: Version control systems, such as Git, allow for collaboration and management of the design system codebase. They provide a way to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with team members on the design system.

Taking the example of React.js and Ant design we can use both of these technologies to create a design system. A highlight of the version 5 of Ant design is the theme system which utilizes CSSinJS to have customizable design tokens. These new theming features reduce the developmenet time for a design system and can be automated via a transformer in GitHub actions as well!

Ant design has three different type of tokens in its theming system: Seed, Map and Alias tokens. The seed tokens are like the basae values, such as primary colors throughout our app, border radius, and spacing. These Seed Tokens go through an algorithm out of which map tokens are automatically generated. These algorithms take in a Seed token as a parameter and they return Map tokens. The next type of token are Map Tokens, which are the more detialed customizable items, like border radius for various sized components, border color, background color and much more. Lastly there are Alias tokens which basically are used to contorl the style in batches. All of these tokens can also be manually assigned values making these tokens highly flexible for customization. 

These Desgin Tokens, can be generated using Figma via a community plugin known as Figma Tokens. This plugin basically creates tokens using a combination of the all the styles in your Figma file, and other custom properties such as border radius. You can specifically download a UI kit for your required componenet or UI library suhc as materials, then Figma Tokens will export the tokens automatically named according to the UI librarie's requirement. For example, in case of Ant Design, one can utilize the Ant Design Figma Kit which also comes with pre configured tokens, so there is no hassle to set up for the designer.

In order to apply your tokens onto your page you can wrap your componenets inside a ConfigProvider component. The Config Provider is a higher-order component (HOC) that provides configuration values for the entire Ant Design system. It enables you to customize the appearance and behavior of Ant Design components and provides a centralized way to configure the design system. This component is typically used at the highest level of your application, usually in the root component, however you can also wrap individual components in the theme providor to assign the theme to the specifically wrapped components. You can apply the theme by passing your tokens into the theme prop in the ConfigProvider, the theme prop accepts any valid JSON object or JavaScript object, which is normally the format which Figma tokens exports the file.

Of we would like to use our theme tokens in an inline style, say to modify the size of a column or a row component in Ant Design, we can use useToken hook provided by Ant Design to extract all of our map tokens in a Javascript object, which we can then assign to our inline style. Keep in mind that useToken extracts the tokens from the nearest parent Config Provider component. So if you have overrided a theme, and its child component calls useToken then the overrided themes tokens will be called instead of the root Config Provider's.

Whenever the designer exports the tokens there is a chain of Github actions that automatically run and then create a commit of the file in the repository, this means that developers do not have to put unnecessary effort into updating the repository as it is automatically done, which allows for easy things like the color and or border radius to be updated accordingly. These Github actions can be programmed in your reopsitory itself and can be linked to Figma via a plugin.

One important concept to keep in mind when building a design system is modularity. By breaking down your system into modular components, you can increase the flexibility and maintainability of your system. This means that each component should be self-contained and reusable, making it easier to apply the design system consistently across different products and services. This is also known as the Atomic design pattern, where you create rudimentary building blocks (Atoms) and use those to build larger systems (Molecules) until you get the desired product. In a design system utilizing Ant Design, your atoms would be the default componenets that UI library provides, and molecules will be layouts of your app that you build using the components in your design system, afterwards the last thing to do would be to create logic for the layouts and put them in containers.

Designs systems are a very powerful tool to make development more streamlined for everyone, and allows for a more clearer communication between the designer and the developer. However, there are still caveats that need to be considered before implementing a design system, these could include:
Over-engineering: One common issue with design systems is over-engineering, where the design system becomes too complex and difficult to maintain. Over-engineering can result in unnecessary features, increasing the design system's complexity and adding development and maintenance costs.

1. Learning curve: Design systems have a learning curve that requires designers, developers, and other stakeholders to become familiar with the design system's patterns, guidelines, and components. This learning curve can increase the time it takes to deliver new designs and development work. All of th e new developers on a project would need to be trained to ensure they do not design compononents incomptaible with our design system.

2. Rigidity: a design system is very rigid and is specifically designed for a UI framework or a component library, e.g in case of Ant Design tokens we cannot apply them on components outside of Ant Design, such as React-Date-Picker and others.

In addition to providing a consistent look and feel, a design system can also help streamline the development process. By creating a library of reusable components and design patterns, designers and developers can work more efficiently and reduce the time and effort required to create new designs. This can also result in faster iteration and prototyping, allowing for a more agile product development process. Overall, a well-implemented design system can have a positive impact on the product development process, resulting in more efficient workflows, a consistent visual language, and a better user experience. By investing in a design system, companies can not only save time and resources, but also improve the overall quality of their products and strengthen their brand identity.
