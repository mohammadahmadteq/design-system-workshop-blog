One of the fundamental principles that we have at Carbotneq are to deliver our client a consistent, reliable and simply beautiful User Interface. But how do we do that, whilst also trying to minimize our developer cost? The answer to our problem is to buiild a Design System! A design system is a collection of visual and interaction elements, guidelines, and templates that define the look and feel of a product or brand. It acts as a blueprint for designing, building, and maintaining digital products and services. A design system can also improve the user experience by providing clear and predictable visual cues, making it easier for users to navigate and understand a product. A well-designed and well-implemented design system can also speed up the design and development process, freeing up time and resources for more complex design challenges. With all of the benefints mentioned above! How do we go about building an automated design system?

Firstly, lets list all of the potential technologies any team would need in order to build a desgin system. These woulsd include:

1. Design software: Design software such as Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma, and InVision can be used to create the visual elements of a design system, such as icons, typography, and color palettes. These tools also allow for collaboration among designers and provide a way to store and manage design assets.

2. Style guides and pattern libraries: Style guides and pattern libraries, such as KSS, Fractal, Living Styleguides, and Ant Design  provide a way to document and organize the components of a design system. They serve as a reference for designers and developers, making it easier to apply the design system consistently across different products and services.

3. Front-end development frameworks: Front-end development frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Foundation, and Material Design, can be used to build the components of a design system. These frameworks provide a set of reusable components and styles, making it easier to create and maintain consistent designs across different products and services.

4. Version control systems: Version control systems, such as Git, allow for collaboration and management of the design system codebase. They provide a way to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with team members on the design system.

Taking the example of React.js and Ant design we can use both of these technologies to create a design system. A highlight of the version 5 of Ant design is the theme system which utilizes CSSinJS to have customizable design tokens. These new theming features reduce the developmenet time for a design system and can be automated via a transformer in GitHub actions as well!

Ant design has three different type of tokens in its themeing system: Seed, Map and Alias tokens. The seed tokens are like the basae values, such as primary colors throughout our app, border radius, and spacing. These Seed Tokens go through an algorithm out of which map tokens are automatically generated. These algorithms take in a Seed token as a parameter and they return Map tokens. The next type of token are Map Tokens, which are the more detialed customizable items, like border radius for various sized components, border color, background color and much more. Lastly there are Alias tokens which basically are used to contorl the style in batches.
